  - title: University of Alberta
    role: Research Assistant
    description:
      - Trained Deep Reinforcement Learning (CNN + Reinforcement learning) models to detect anatomical landmarks on medical images
      - Used the detected landmarks and non-deformable registration techniques to register echocardiography images taken from different views
      - Compared the results using qualitative and quantitative methods. Results yielded an overall Dice score of 0.80 which was 0.57 for the original images
      - "**Tools, Libraries used**: Reinforcement Learning, Pytorch, ITK, Simple Elastix, AntsPy, 3D Slicer"

    role: Content Development Support
    description:
      - "Conducted independent research to design a flask-based microservice application and configured CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions to automatically build artifacts, docker image and deploy upon code changes to AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service. (GitHub repository: https://github.com/Amii-Training/cloud)"
      - "**Tools used**: Python, Flask, GitHub Actions, Docker, K8s, AWS EKS, PyPI"
      - Developed a CNN model with an accuracy of 0.9 to classify regions where land is being used in satellite images obtained through Landsat which have a low spatial resolution
      - Implemented appropriate Google Colab notebooks based on the client's needs
